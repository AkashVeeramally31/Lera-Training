Data Validation and Error Handling in Spring Boot
Introduction
Data validation and error handling are crucial aspects of any web application to ensure data integrity, prevent invalid inputs, and provide meaningful feedback to users. Spring Boot provides built-in support for validation and error handling using annotations like @Valid, @ExceptionHandler, and @RestControllerAdvice, along with custom exception handling mechanisms.

1) Data Validation in Spring Boot
What is Data Validation?
Data validation ensures that input data meets defined constraints before being processed. It helps prevent invalid, incomplete, or malicious data from entering the system.
Spring Boot integrates with Jakarta Validation API (formerly Javax Validation API), which provides annotation-based validation.

Validation Annotations in Spring Boot
Spring Boot uses Jakarta Validation (jakarta.validation.constraints) to validate request data. Some commonly used validation annotations include:

Annotation	Description
@NotNull	Ensures the field is not null
@NotBlank	Ensures the field is not blank (for Strings)
@NotEmpty	Ensures the field is not empty (for Collections, Strings, etc.)
@Min(value)	Ensures the number is not less than the specified minimum value
@Max(value)	Ensures the number is not greater than the specified maximum value
@Size(min, max)	Ensures the field has a length within the given range
@Email	Ensures a valid email format
@Pattern(regex)	Ensures the field matches the specified regular expression.

How to Implement Validation?
Step 1: Define a DTO (Data Transfer Object) with Validation Constraints
A DTO is used to transfer data while applying validation constraints.

Step 2: Apply Validation in Controller
The @Valid annotation is used in a controller method to enforce validation.

2) Exception Handling

Exception handling refers to the process of catching, managing, and responding to exceptions in a structured way. 
It ensures that:
Users receive meaningful error messages.
The application does not crash unexpectedly.
Logs capture relevant error details for debugging.

Annotations in Exception Handling:-
Annotation			Description
@ExceptionHandler	Handles specific exceptions at the controller level
@RestControllerAdvice	Global exception handling for the entire application
@ResponseStatus		Sets HTTP status code for custom exceptions


Spring Boot provides multiple ways to handle exceptions:
1) Custom Exceptions
2) Global Exception Handling (@RestControllerAdvice)
3) Spring Boot’s Default Error Handling Mechanism
4) Custom Error Responses


1. Custom Exceptions in Spring Boot
1.1 What Are Custom Exceptions?
A custom exception is a user-defined exception that extends Java’s RuntimeException or Exception class. It allows developers to create meaningful exception messages tailored to their application’s needs.

1.2 Why Use Custom Exceptions?
To improve code readability and maintainability.
To provide specific error messages based on different error conditions.
To separate business logic from exception handling logic.
1.3 How to Create a Custom Exception?
A custom exception can be created by extending RuntimeException or Exception.


2. Global Exception Handling (@RestControllerAdvice)
2.1 What is Global Exception Handling?
Handling exceptions at the global level ensures that all controllers share the same error-handling logic. Instead of handling exceptions separately in every controller, we can define a global exception handler using @RestControllerAdvice.

2.2 Why Use Global Exception Handling?
Eliminates repetitive exception-handling code in controllers.
Provides a centralized mechanism to handle errors.
Helps in logging and debugging errors efficiently.
2.3 How to Implement Global Exception Handling?
Use @RestControllerAdvice with @ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions globally.

3. Spring Boot’s Default Error Handling Mechanism
3.1 What is Spring Boot's Default Error Handling?
Spring Boot provides a built-in error-handling mechanism using the BasicErrorController, which automatically generates a JSON response when an exception occurs.

3.2 How Does It Work?
When an unhandled exception is thrown in a Spring Boot application:

Spring Boot catches the exception.
It generates a default JSON error response.
The response contains details like timestamp, status code, error message, path, etc.

Advantages of Default Error Handling
✅ Provides a standard error format.
✅ No additional configuration is required.
✅ Works automatically for 404 NOT FOUND, 400 BAD REQUEST, etc.


4. Custom Error Responses
4.1 What Are Custom Error Responses?
Sometimes, the default error response may not be user-friendly or may contain unnecessary details. Custom error responses allow developers to format error messages according to their needs.

4.2 Why Use Custom Error Responses?
To provide structured error messages that are more meaningful.
To remove unnecessary fields from default Spring Boot error responses.
To ensure consistent error response format across the application.
4.3 How to Create a Custom Error Response?
Define a class for the custom error response.

Step 1: Create an Error Response DTO
Step 2: Modify the Global Exception Handler to Use the Custom Error Response.



Comparison of Exception Handling Approaches in Spring Boot:-
	Approach								Description							When to Use?
Custom Exceptions					Define user-specific exceptions by extending RuntimeException.	When you need meaningful exception names for specific cases.
Global Exception Handling (@RestControllerAdvice)	Centralized exception handling for the entire application.	When you want to handle all exceptions in one place.
Spring Boot’s Default Error Handling			Built-in error-handling mechanism.				When no custom handling is needed (suitable for quick projects).
Custom Error Responses					Return structured and meaningful error messages.		When you want to control the error format returned to users.
